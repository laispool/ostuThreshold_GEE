# Otsu Threshold Algorithm
The Otsu Threshold Algorithm is a popular image processing technique used for automatic threshold selection. It was introduced by Nobuyuki Otsu in 1979 and has since been widely adopted in various fields, including computer vision, image segmentation, and object recognition.

## Description
The Otsu Threshold Algorithm aims to determine an optimal threshold value for image binarization. Binarization refers to the process of converting a grayscale image into a binary image, where each pixel is assigned either a black or white value based on its intensity level.

The algorithm assumes that the grayscale histogram of an image consists of two classes: the background and the foreground. The goal is to find a threshold that maximizes the separability between these two classes. Once the threshold is determined, it can be used to separate the foreground and background pixels, effectively segmenting the image.

## Usage
The Otsu Threshold Algorithm available it this repository is to be implemented in Code Editor (Earth Engine) platform. 
You just have to copy and past to your own script, remember to create the histogram of the image as indicated on the algorithm coments.
